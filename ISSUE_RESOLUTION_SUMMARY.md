# Issue Resolution: Windows Startup and macOS Time Tracking Problems

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### Issue 1: Windows Startup Problems
**Problem**: App autostart at login didn't work reliably on some Windows systems.

**Root Causes**:
1. Hard failure on autostart setup using `.expect()` which would crash the app
2. Insufficient error handling for hook installation failures
3. No retry mechanism for failed hook setups
4. Missing directory creation for log/backup folders

**Solutions Implemented**:

#### 1. Graceful Autostart Handling
```rust
// Before (would crash if autostart fails):
app.autolaunch().enable().expect("Failed to enable autostart");

// After (continues running even if autostart fails):
if let Err(e) = app.autolaunch().enable() {
    eprintln!("Warning: Failed to enable autostart: {}", e);
    // Continue execution instead of panicking
} else {
    println!("Autostart enabled successfully");
}
```

#### 2. Robust Hook Setup with Retry Logic
- Added retry mechanism (up to 5 attempts) for Windows hook installation
- Proper error handling and resource cleanup for failed hooks
- Better error messages and status reporting
- Automatic retry with delays between attempts

#### 3. Directory Creation Safety
- Ensured log and backup directories are created before use
- Added error handling for directory creation failures
- Graceful degradation when directories can't be created

### Issue 2: macOS Time Tracking Suspension
**Problem**: Time tracking would suspend/stop working after some time on macOS laptops.

**Root Causes**:
1. Event taps can be disabled by macOS due to security policies or system state changes
2. Run loops can exit unexpectedly during sleep/wake cycles
3. No recovery mechanism when event taps fail
4. Lack of monitoring to detect when tracking stops

**Solutions Implemented**:

#### 1. Event Tap Recovery System
```rust
// Added monitoring and auto-restart for event taps
#[cfg(target_os = "macos")]
static EVENT_TAP_RUNNING: AtomicBool = AtomicBool::new(false);

// Monitoring thread that restarts event tap if it stops
std::thread::spawn(|| {
    loop {
        std::thread::sleep(Duration::from_secs(30)); // Check every 30 seconds
        
        if !EVENT_TAP_RUNNING.load(Ordering::SeqCst) {
            println!("Event tap not running, attempting restart...");
            setup_hooks(); // Recursive call to restart
            break;
        }
    }
});
```

#### 2. Enhanced Error Handling
- Added proper error handling for event tap creation
- Check if event tap is enabled before proceeding
- Retry mechanism with delays for failed event taps
- Better error reporting with specific failure reasons

#### 3. Health Monitoring System
Created a comprehensive health monitoring system that:
- Tracks the last activity time
- Monitors for extended periods without activity
- Provides warnings when time tracking may have stopped
- Offers a command to check system health status

```rust
// New health monitoring features:
pub fn get_health_status() -> String // Tauri command for frontend
pub fn report_activity()            // Called on each user activity
pub fn initialize_health_monitoring() // Starts monitoring thread
```

### Additional Improvements

#### 1. Enhanced Time Tracker Resilience
- Added error recovery in the event processing loop
- Prevents thread crashes from stopping time tracking
- Implements backoff strategy for consecutive errors
- Better error logging and debugging information

#### 2. Improved File Operations
- All file operations now use atomic writes with backups
- Better error handling for encryption/decryption operations
- More frequent backups (every 10 operations instead of 50)
- Enhanced backup validation and recovery

#### 3. Better Logging and Diagnostics
- Added comprehensive error logging
- Status messages for successful operations
- Health status reporting accessible from frontend
- Clear error messages for troubleshooting

## How to Monitor the Fixes

### For Windows:
1. Check system tray messages for hook setup status
2. Monitor console output for autostart success/failure
3. Verify log files are being created in `C:\fairsight-log`
4. Check backup files in `C:\fairsight-backup`

### For macOS:
1. Monitor console output for event tap status
2. Use the new health status command from the frontend
3. Check log files in `~/Documents/rs-fairsight`
4. Verify the monitoring thread reports activity correctly

### New Frontend Health Check
A new command `get_health_status()` is available that returns:
- "Time tracking is working normally" (if activity within last minute)
- "Last activity X seconds ago" (if activity within last 10 minutes)
- "Warning: No activity for X seconds" (if no activity for over 10 minutes)

## Testing Recommendations

### Windows Startup Testing:
1. Add the app to Windows startup apps
2. Restart the computer multiple times
3. Check if hooks are properly installed after each restart
4. Verify time tracking works immediately after startup

### macOS Sleep/Wake Testing:
1. Start the app and verify time tracking works
2. Put the laptop to sleep for extended periods
3. Wake the laptop and verify time tracking resumes
4. Check the health status after wake-up
5. Monitor for automatic recovery if tracking stops

### Long-Running Testing:
1. Run the app for extended periods (24+ hours)
2. Monitor the health status periodically
3. Check for automatic recovery from temporary failures
4. Verify backup files are created regularly

## Recovery Mechanisms

The new system implements multiple layers of recovery:

1. **Immediate Recovery**: Retry failed operations with exponential backoff
2. **Short-term Recovery**: Monitor and restart failed subsystems within minutes
3. **Long-term Recovery**: Validate data integrity and restore from backups
4. **Graceful Degradation**: Continue core functionality even if some features fail

These improvements should significantly reduce both the Windows startup issues and the macOS time tracking suspension problems while providing better visibility into the system's health.
