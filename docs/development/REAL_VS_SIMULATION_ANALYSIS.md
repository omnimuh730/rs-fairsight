# Data Flow Analysis - Real vs Simulation Mode

## ‚úÖ Real Packet Capture Mode (PRIORITY)

When real packet capture is available, the system uses **100% real network data**:

### Real Data Flow:
1. **Packet Capture**: `pcap` library captures real network packets
2. **Real Packet Size**: `packet.header.len as u64` - actual bytes from network
3. **Real Protocol/Port**: Parsed from actual packet headers (TCP/UDP/etc.)
4. **Real Host Analysis**: `process_host_from_packet()` with actual IPs
5. **Real Service Analysis**: `process_service_from_packet()` with actual ports/protocols
6. **Real DNS/GeoIP**: Lookups performed on actual destination IPs

### Functions Used (Real Mode):
- `process_real_packet()` - Main processing function
- `process_host_from_packet()` - Real host tracking with DNS/GeoIP
- `process_service_from_packet()` - Real service identification
- `update_overall_stats()` - Real byte/packet counting

### Data Sources (Real Mode):
- **Bytes**: `packet.header.len` (actual packet size)
- **Packets**: Incremented by 1 per real packet
- **IPs**: Parsed from packet headers
- **Ports**: Extracted from TCP/UDP headers
- **Protocols**: Identified from packet analysis

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Simulation Mode (FALLBACK ONLY)

Only used when real packet capture **fails** due to:
- No admin/root privileges
- Network adapter not found
- Driver issues
- Development environment limitations

### Simulation Functions (Fallback Only):
- `simulate_traffic_tick()` - Generates test data
- `simulate_service()` - Creates sample service data  
- `simulate_realistic_host()` - Adds sample hosts

### When Simulation Runs:
```rust
// Only executes if create_packet_capture() returns None
if let Some(mut capture) = capture_opt {
    // ‚úÖ REAL PACKET CAPTURE MODE
} else {
    // ‚ö†Ô∏è SIMULATION FALLBACK MODE
}
```

## üîç How to Verify Real Mode is Active

Look for these console messages:

### Real Mode Messages:
```
‚úÖ Real packet capture active for [adapter_name]
üîç Monitoring live network traffic with enhanced host analysis
Successfully opened packet capture on [adapter_name]
```

### Simulation Mode Messages:
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Real packet capture unavailable for adapter: [adapter_name] 
üîÑ Using simulation mode for development/testing purposes
üí° To capture real traffic, run with admin privileges or check adapter permissions
```

## üéØ Conclusion

**Your concern was valid** - simulation functions do use calculated/estimated data. However:

1. **Real packet capture is prioritized** and uses 100% real network data
2. **Simulation only runs as fallback** when real capture is impossible
3. **The system clearly indicates** which mode is active via console messages
4. **Most production deployments** will use real packet capture mode

To ensure you're getting real data:
- Run with administrator/root privileges
- Check console messages for "Real packet capture active"
- Verify network adapter permissions
